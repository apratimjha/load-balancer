Advanced Load Balancer
A Python implementation comparing three load balancing algorithms, featuring an intelligent Load Aware Balancer that outperforms traditional methods.
🚀 Algorithms

Round Robin - Basic cyclic distribution
Least Connections - Connection-based balancing
Load Aware ⭐ - Advanced intelligent balancing

🎯 Load Aware Balancer Features
Why It's Better

Smart server selection - Considers both capacity utilization and active requests
Request queuing - Queues overflow requests instead of dropping them
Health monitoring - Background health checks with automatic failover
Real-time adaptation - Dynamic server pool management
Complete request tracking - Monitors full request lifecycle

Key Advantages

Higher success rates through intelligent queuing
Better resource utilization with capacity-aware assignment
Fault tolerance via continuous health monitoring
Scalable performance under varying loads

🚀 Quick Start
bashpip install matplotlib
python load_balancer.py
📊 Output
The system generates performance charts comparing:

Average assignment times
Success rates
Real-time processing logs

🔧 Configuration
pythonservers = {
    "web-01": 100,
    "web-02": 150, 
    "web-03": 400
}

la_balancer = LoadAwareBalancer(
    servers,
    request_timeout=5,
    health_check_interval=10
)
🏆 Results
Load Aware Balancer consistently achieves:

Higher success rates (queuing vs dropping)
Better resource usage (capacity-aware)
Improved reliability (health monitoring)


Efficient load distribution with intelligent server management
